# Project Overview:
This project involves developing a new version of a retail company's e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. The primary goal is to create a static prototype of the website, focusing on the structure, design, and responsiveness without incorporating any dynamic behavior via JavaScript. This prototype will serve as the first phase of the project, allowing the company to evaluate the design before deciding on further development.
